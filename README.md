This is a project, that we did during the training course "TeachMeSkills" company. (this is not graduating project)

This is usual online store + if you have "admin" role you can manage all orders, all users.


I used in my project:
- Spring MVC
- Hibernate
- H2Database
- i18n
- Maven

To start the application you should have servlet container (Tomcat or something like this).

I used h2database, so you don't need to confige any database.
